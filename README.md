# Propylon Document Manager Assessment

The Propylon Document Management Technical Assessment is a simple (and incomplete) web application consisting of a basic API backend and a React based client.  This API/client can be used as a bootstrap to implement the specific features requested in the assessment description. 

## Getting Started
1. [Install Direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)
2. [Install Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)
3. This project requires Python 3.11 so you will need to ensure that this version of Python is installed on your OS before building the virtual environment.
4. `$ cp example.env .envrc`
5. `$ direnv allow .`
6. `$ pipenv install -r requirements/local.txt`.  If Python 3.11 is not the default Python version on your system you may need to explicitly create the virtual environment (`$ python3.11 -m venv .venv`) prior to running the install command. 
7. `$ pipenv run python manage.py migrate` to create the database.
8. `$ pipenv run python manage.py load_file_fixtures` to create the fixture file versions.
9. `$ pipenv run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001` to start the development server on port 8001.
10. Navigate to the client/doc-manager directory.
11. `$ npm install` to install the dependencies.
12. `$ npm start` to start the React development server.
